### Important Note

This folder is auto generated by the swagger code generator program.

## Exceptions

- The `models.ts` from Swagger is not required. However the contents should replace `index.ts`.
- `common.ts` is manually created and should not be deleted.
- If replaced all contents of `index.ts` ensure `export * from './common';` is added back in.
